<h2>About</h2>
<p>Finn is a trans artist located in the Bay Area and originally from Portland, Oregon. He finds inspiration from hands, dreams, memories, and creatures of all kinds. When he's not drawing, he enjoys spending time with his friends and family, sleeping, and playing music. He also built this website using github, which may come with a few bugs as he is still learning (as in most aspects of life). Thank you for visiting <3  </p>
